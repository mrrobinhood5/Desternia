Kermit was found near a swamp on the west side of Rosemere. He is a male. He may probably be the last one, they live
forever and rarely move around unless they are gonna eat.

The arena is not the best place to take full advantage of kermit, but if anyone casts darkness, he can use the
Shadow Step

What makes Kermit difficult is his swallow.

To Play Kermit, follow these guidelines:
Add Kermit to init by ( !i madd kermit -name "Kermit" )
* Heres the order of attacks: Tongue, Bite, Swallow.
* Tongue attack pulls them in within Bite Distance, and gives a bonus action to Bite IF they fail the grapple check.
  You cant do swallow in the same turn as a Tongue/Bite combo
  ( !i a tongue -t target )
  ( !c acro -dc 15 )
* Bite attack once they are in melee, another acro check to be grappled. You can only Swallow a grappled creature.
  ( !i a bite -t target )
* Once they are grappled, and you make a bite attack, if the attack hits, they are swallowed.
* Every turn they start inside of Kermit do a Swallow attack to deal acid damage
  ( !i a swallow -t target )
* The goal is to just swallow as fast as possible.
* Again, kermit can be beat easily by fighting it from far away, or with a flying creature.
