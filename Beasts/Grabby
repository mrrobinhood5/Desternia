Grabby was found near the north mountains. He is a male. There is a female left in the wild and at some point the plan
is to reunite them. There are a bunch of babies, and they give live births.

What makes Grabby difficult is that he has the ranged acid splash, and a powerful bite.

To Play Grabby, follow these guidelines:
Add grabby to init by ( !i madd grabby -name "Grabby" )
* When players set themselves up around him for ranged attacks, use the Acid Splash ( !i a acid -t target )
* Acid Splash needs to be answered by a dex save. Its easier to have all the affected players just do the save before
  attack. The monster attacks don't automate the saves correctly, so those who pass need to recover 1/2 of the damage.
  ( !hp +10 )
* After Acid Splashing, move towards them
* When players are in Melee distance, leverage the bite. ( !i a bite -t target ) if the bite hits, players must
  contest a grapple since Grabby will hold down its bite. Players do ( !c acro -dc 14 ) to see if they are grappled.
* Grabby can only keep biting down on the same character WITH ADVANTAGE, if there are more than one players, you can move the grappled
  player with you towards the other PCs
* If at any point Grabby starts to get overwhelemed, burrow down to avoid getting hit, and pop up to acid splash.
* Grabby cannot SEE. Therefore he waits for the player to move towards him or make noise. (This is how to beat him)
* If a player catches on and uses things to distract him, make Grabby follow the distraction.
