## Language Learning

!tembed -title "Learning the Languages"	-desc "You can spend your time learning languages. You can do so **with** or **without** a mentor. Ability for learning language is **INTELLIGENCE**"
-f "LEARNING|```200 - ((( INT x 2 ) - 20) x 10) = Total Number of Downtimes (minimum of 20) ```
- If you train with a mentor, you can **QUARTER** that number (rounded up)
- You can only do Language Learning for 2 DT per day rolling **Intelligence** check with DC 10
- 1 gp per day, regardless of how many checks you passed or if you used 1 or 2 DT
- Languages take up 1 Proficiency Training Slot (You can only have 6)"
-f "EXAMPLE|```You are a commoner with 12 INT and wants to learn Elvish from a Wood Elf mentor, twice a day.
Multiply 12 (INT) by 2 = 24
Subtract 20 from 24 = 4
Multiply 4 by 10 = 40
Subtract 40 from 200 = 160 Downtimes (80 full days, 80gp minimum)
Since you have a mentor:
160 divided by 4 = 40 Downtimes (20 full Days, 20gp minimum)
Doing it twice a day:
40 divided by 2 = 20 Days (minimum) and 20gp (minimum)```"
-f "SETUP|```!dt learn set -lang \"Language\" -mentor \"Mentor Name\"```"
-f "USAGE|```!dt learn -lang \"Language\" [part]```"

```TRAINING 
Given enough free time and the services of an instruc-
tor, a character can learn a language or pick up profi-
ciency with a tool.
Resources. Receiving training in a language or tool
typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is
reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the char-
acter's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty
doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp
per workweek

EXAMPLE: 
INT of 0 will be 250gp & 70 days
INT of 2 will be 200gp & 50 days```

PHB Pg 187
```TRAINING
You can spend time between adventures learning a new
language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might
allow additional training options.
First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.
The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one
or more ability checks are required.
The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with
the new tool.

EXAMPLE: 
FIND Mentor & 250 days & 250gp```
