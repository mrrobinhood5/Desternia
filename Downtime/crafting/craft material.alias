-f "Common - 1gp Daily, 1x Time, 1x Value | Materials are readily available materials, that are essential to a functioning society. Copper, Iron, Oak, cow hide, and granite are examples of such easy to find, and relatively cheap materials. The base price assumes common materials resulting in no modification to the value or time to craft an item"
-f "Uncommon - 5gp Daily, 2x Time, 2.5x Value | Materials are still available if you have the money. They are more difficult to prepare, and generally valued above simple common items which adds to the time and cost to craft with Uncommon items, but leads to greater value as well. Garnets, Dwarven Steel, Common Mithril, Silver, Iron-Oak, and Marble are all examples of Uncommon materials."
-f "Rare - 30gp Daily, 3x Time, 15x Value | Materials can sometimes be found from the occasional vendor for extreme prices, but most typically these materials require quests to go out and track them down. Many adventurers just starting out will take quests from Guilds in search of these rare items for their benefactors to turn into profitable creations. Such items include Gold, Rubies, Emeralds, Noble Mithril, Adamantine, and Wyvern hides."
-f "Very Rare - 200gp Daily, 5x Time, 100x Value | Materials cannot be found for sale. Those that have time guard their treasures carefully. Quests for such materials often require experienced adventurers capable of spending months fighting through monstrosities that now inhabit an ancient mine. Examples include legendary gemstones like the Star Ruby, Royal Mithril, or Dragon Hide"
-f "Legendary - 1000gp Daily, 10x Time, 500x Value | Materials have a mythical status. Only the most powerful of adventurers are typically capable of locating and surviving the quest to retrieve such items. Such materials are often thought of as being priceless, and much of this class of material are remnants of Titans, and other Primordial beings scattered though the planes"
