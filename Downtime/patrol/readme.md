## Downtime Rolls
- First scout out potential criminals with **Perception** or **Investigation**. If another player is doing criminal downtime, you can contest it with your own check to attempt to catch them. If you are not providing a name you will continue to roll against a random criminal.
- Second check your **Stealth** with **Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom**. This represents your attempt of going unnoticed to attempt to catch the criminal.
- Third check is **Athletics or Persuasion**. This represents either grappling the criminal, or talking him into taking him in.
