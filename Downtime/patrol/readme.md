# City Watch - Rosemere's Finest

Crime is taken very seriously in Rosemere. The City Watch is a guild of able bodied good doers committed to fighting crime and keeping our streets safe. City Watchment patrol the streets for petty crime, to big crimes during their stay at Rosemere.

## **Downtime Rolls**
- First scout out potential targets with **Perception** or **Investigation**
- Second check your **Stealth**. This represents your attempt of going unnoticed. If you have a Disguise Kit, you can roll with Advantage.
- Third check your **Sleight of Hand**. If you have Thieves Tools, you can roll with that instead.
