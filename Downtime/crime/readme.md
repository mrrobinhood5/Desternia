# Crime in the City

Crime is taken very seriously in Rosemere. It can be costly and very lucrative. Not all characters are fit for the criminal world. Downtime crimes are limited to small/medium crimes agains notional residents. **DO NOT TRY TO BREAK INTO THE RAVENS QUILL** or stuff like that.

## **Downtime Rolls**
- First scout out potential targets with **Perception** or **Investigation**
- Second check your **Stealth**. This represents your attempt of going unnoticed. If you have a Disguise Kit, you can roll with Advantage.
- Third check your **Sleight of Hand**. If you have Thieves Tools, you can roll with that instead. 

```py
SCOUT Roll
ROLL  | Outcome                   | Modifier
0-9   | Failed to find anyone     | TRY AGAIN!
10-11 | Poor                      | .2
12-14 | Commoners (Modest)        | .5
15-17 | Middle Class (Comfortable)|  1
18-19 | Upper Class (Wealthy)     |  2
20+   | Nobles (Aristocratic)     |  3
```
**Rules**
- You perform the 3 checks with a Random DC of `2d10 + Level % 3`.
- The city watch will be pinged when you do crime, and they may attempt to catch you based on your **Stealth** Check and their `!dt patrol` downtime.
- Crime Downtime costs 2gp per day (1gp per DT), but the payout is greater
- Payout is your investment times modifier if you do not get caught.
