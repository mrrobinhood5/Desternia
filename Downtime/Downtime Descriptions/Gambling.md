## Heat
When the dealer bets and wins, you must cover their winnings. 
* Example: You bet 10gp on `high` numbers, the dealer will also bet 10gp on a random choice [odd, even, high, low]. If he wins, you must cover their winnings.  
If you cannot cover the cost of the dealers winning, you gain +2 Heat.
You can play with heat, but: 

| Heat | Consequence |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 15 + | Cannot do Gamble DT |
| 10 + | Dealer Rolls Twice. |
| 5 +  | You pay 10% tax on your winnings |

## Renown
If you win a single number, gain +2 Renown
If you win any other, gain +1 Renown

| Renown | Perks |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 10  | If dealer wins, only pay half |
| 25  | You can roll twice |
