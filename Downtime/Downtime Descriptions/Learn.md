## Rolls
* Learn Roll - Intelligence Roll

You must roll a number of times equal to the following formula or 20, whichever is greater. Highly intelligent PCs will learn faster.:

```
200 - ((( Intelligence x 2 ) - 20) x 10) = Total Number of Downtimes (minimum of 20)
```

Simplified:
```
Intelligence Score x 2
subtract 20 from that
multiply it by 10
subract it from 200
```

Learning from a mentor takes that number and halves it. Each downtime is 1 roll, so you can do 2 rolls per day for the same price.
